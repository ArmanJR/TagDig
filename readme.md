A local email classifier inspired by the Persian food "TahDig". TagDig uses small large language models to tag, classify and organize your personal emails without any data leaving your device.

## Features

TagDig currently supports email classification into the following categories:

1. **Job Application Emails** - Identifies recruitment and job-related correspondence
2. **Meeting Emails** - Detects meeting invitations and scheduling communications

More categories coming.

## Job Application Classification

Our current focus is on **Job application-related emails**. We are actively benchmarking different models and prompts to optimize performance.

### Benchmarking

TBD
